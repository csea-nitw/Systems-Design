# POOLING AND STREAMING

* Polling: act of fetching a resource or piece of data regularly at an interval to make sure your data is not too stable
    * At every x seconds, clients issue requests at some interval to the Server for data
    * Limitations: For chat apps, we canâ€™t poll everything all the time without taking resources

* Streaming: in networking, it usually refers to the act of continuously getting a feed of information from a server by keeping an open connection between the two machines or processes
    * Instead of having clients to repeat requests, clients open a long-lived request using a socket
    * Socket: a kind of file that acts like a stream. Processes can read and write to sockets and communicate in this manner. Most of the time the sockets are fronts for TCP connection while on hosts in a Cient-Server model.
    * Allows clients to continuously receive messages from the server
    * Instantaneous experience by clients  

# Technologies

* Websocket
* HTTP/2 Streaming

# Server

* Start the server with the following...

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-server.yaml up --build

# Start the clients

After dockering the solution, you need to use the name of the chat_server according to docker-compose. Since the container is in an isolated network, you need to join it (`--network`).

* Client with Poll mode

```
$ docker run -ti --rm -e MODE=poll -e NAME=leandro -e WS_SERVER_HOST_PORT=chat_server:3001 --network=streaming marcellodesales/systemsexpert-polling-streaming run client

> polling-streaming-algo-designexpert@1.0.0 client /app
> node client.js

> chat-room: Welcome user
> marcello: OI... alguem ai
> leandro: tudo bem?
> bot: e com vcs?
> bot: Rapaz aqui ta bom
> leandro: como?
> marcello: sim?
> superbot: 1
> superbot: 2
```

* Client with Streaming mode

```
$ docker run --rm -ti -e MODE=stream -e NAME=marcello -e WS_SERVER_HOST_PORT=chat_server:3001
     --network=streaming marcellodesales/systemsexpert-polling-streaming run client

> polling-streaming-algo-designexpert@1.0.0 client /app
> node client.js

> chat-room: Welcome user
OI... alguem ai
> leandro: tudo bem?
> bot: e com vcs?
> bot: Rapaz aqui ta bom
> leandro: como?
sim?
> superbot: 1
> superbot: 2
```

* Client with Streaming Bot: You need to exec into a container before generating all the numbers to be submitted to see the experiment
  * All streaming clients get the messages at the same time
  * All polling clients get the messages at every 3 seconds in chunks. (Not a good user experience)

> NOTE: Within the container, the bot client is NOT showing each number being sent to the clients
```
$ docker run -ti --rm --entrypoint sh -e MODE=stream -e NAME=bot -e WS_SERVER_HOST_PORT=chat_server:3001 --network=streaming marcellodesales/systemsexpert-polling-streaming
/app #

/app # (for i in `seq 1 10000`; do sleep 1; echo $i; done) | NAME=superbot node client.js
> chat-room: Welcome user
> marcello: OI... alguem ai
> leandro: tudo bem?
> bot: e com vcs?
> bot: Rapaz aqui ta bom
> leandro: como?
> marcello: sim?
```
